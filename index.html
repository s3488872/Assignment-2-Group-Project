    Hi, I’m Natanya and I’m from Melbourne - I was born in Sri Lanka and migrated to Australia when I was four. My passions are travel, fashion, photography, singing, design, and social psychology. I’m also passionate about the environment, international aid; and volunteering in these areas! I have travelled over the years to around 16 or so countries, in various capacities, learning the national languages where I could. After graduating high school in 2013, I went on to study a Bachelor of Fashion Design at RMIT for two years. Realising it wasn’t for me, and not what I wanted to do career-wise, I travelled and worked on and off, before considering enrolling in an IT degree. My pursuits in various areas over the years led me to realise I enjoyed things of a practical and logical nature, and my affinity for tech also made it easier to decide on this. Being a growing field, I found IT an ideal sector to enter, and already had some knowledge of the field through my brother (an IT consultant), and my own exploration and life experiences. Currently, I’d like to explore the areas of cloud-computing and cybersecurity, but am aware this might change. I’m a member of the team: Powerpuff Girls.

    Hi I’m Martina and I am Australian Vietnamese. I like to play the keyboard, guitar and ukulele, and my go-to songs to play are either recent pop songs or ballads that I learn off of Youtube. One other thing is that I never fail to sing or hum a tune at least once a day. I started in the field of commerce fresh after high school, but I always had a small interest in the field of information technology, so I actually switched midway through my previous degree to pursue IT at RMIT. My understanding in IT is basic even though I grew up with technology all around me. The closest IT experience I have is in my everyday consumption of all the different technologies surrounding me, but I am keen to learn more about information technology in this Bachelor’s at RMIT.

    Hello, My name is Wendy Si and my student number is s3898700. I am from Shanghai, but was born and raised in Melbourne. My date of birth is the 8th of February 2003 and my background is Chinese. I graduated from Nossal High School in 2020 and am now a first year Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I can speak English and Mandarin Chinese, and can understand Shanghainese. A fun fact about me is that I used to be a state level swimmer when I was around 10 years old. My hobbies are playing video games, reading manga, watching anime, going clubbing and going out with friends. My interest in Information Technology is mainly centred around the coding aspect, I am interested in creating programs and learning the languages. I like how Information Technology is very practical as well, with getting the opportunity to make things. This allows me to implement what I’ve learnt and be able to create projects and sharpen my skills. My experience in Information Technology is very minimal. I learnt enough HTML to build a website back in 2017 and completed an online course in Python 2 in 2018, however those skills are long forgotten as I haven’t retained my knowledge from that time. Our team's chosen name is the Powerpuff Girls.</p>

    Hi, my name is Thao and I am an Australian born Vietnamese. I was born on the 3rd of September, 2002, in Melbourne. I attended high school at Koonung Secondary College located in Mont Albert North and am currently in the process of completing my Bachelor of Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. My hobbies include drawing, badminton, reading, binge watching anime and you can often find me spending my Centrelink funds on food along Swanston Street. I have little experience with IT, other than the typical functionings of Microsoft programs, therefore I was interested in this course to challenge myself and learn more regarding different aspects of Information Technology. I also decided to pursue the information technology field as it plays such a fundamental role to today’s society. I am especially interested in the User Centred Design aspect of Information Technology, as I enjoy learning about how society utilises aspects of IT, to communicate ideas and make websites that appeal to audiences.

    <h4>Autonomous Vehicles:</h4>

    <p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are self-driving cars which means it is driverless, fully reliant on the computer systems, and passengers can focus on completely different tasks to driving. There are five levels with autonomous vehicles, ranging from level 1, to level 5 which is what a driverless AV is. At present, only some companies have at most reached level 3, conditional automation, where the driver can rely on the vehicle to take control in traffic that is moving the same way, such as on highways, but must still be attentive and ready to take over. At level 1 and 2, we have Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), as mentioned by (Infrastructure partnerships Australia, 2017) and (Wevolver, 2020), which include some features such as keeping cars in their lane, driving on cruise control on highways, self-parking cars and automatic brakes in accident prone situations. Full automation is still in progress due to the limitations of machine learning and insufficient data collection. As driving is a task that requires fast and accurate responses to a car’s surroundings, and is a difficult task even for humans to carry out, it has proven to be much more complicated to creators which is why the timeline for AVs to become a reality is still unknown (Piper, 2020).
    </p>
    <img src="av pic 1.jpg" width="800" height="331">
    <p style="padding: 20em 0 0 0"> Figure 1: Levels of driving automation summary (Wevolver 2020) </p>

    <p> Autonomous vehicles contain many components for it to be driverless and moving safely and accurately on public roads. Some of the essential equipment include cameras, sensors, computer systems, but also electronic access to the brakes, steering wheel, and pedals. The computer systems in AVs collect copious amounts of data in real time and this learning continuously occurs overtime. This process is referred to as machine learning which is aided by artificial intelligence tools. Machine learning can be parallel to a human creating infinite connections from information given to them, to then being able to make predictions on their own (Dia 2021). So similarly, machine learning in AVs improves and deepens over time as it constantly learns and builds on its ability to predict solutions to all types of interactions while it drives (Cohen 2018, 2018).

    </p>
    <img src="av pic 2.jpg" width="" height="">
    <p style="padding: 22em 0 0 0"> Figure 2: Multiple examples of perception in self-driving cars (Massey 2017) </p>
    <p>Perception in robots and machines, requires a combination of tools. AVs use cameras and multiple types of sensors to be able to ‘see’ while it drives. Not only does an AV need sight, but it also needs to be able to detect objects near, and far accurately. For example, a driving car would need to be able to tell the difference between a human on a mobility scooter, compared to a supermarket trolley. This is done through the combination of using ‘object classification (knowing what the object actually is),’ and ‘object localisation (which is essentially know where each object is situated),’   which is then executed with multiple algorithms to achieve accurate object detection in AVs (Lai 2018). Localisation is essential for vehicles which is achieved with both highly detailed maps and sensor fusion. Cameras on their own, have weaknesses in practise such as sun glare and bad weather conditions. Some AVs also use radar sensors, LIDAR or even ultrasound sensors. LIDAR uses light waves to be able to localise a vehicle, but rain and bad weather render it useless. It is also extremely dear equipment which further hinders many companies from being able to resource it for their AVs. Radar uses radio waves to help machines see but provides poor vision in comparison to LIDAR. On the other hand, ultrasonic sensors are also evident in some companies work with AVs, but its’ limitation is that it does not have a large range of distance that it can perceive. As seen, all sensors have their limitations but in combination with one or the other, using sensor fusion (Burke, 2019), and a very popular technique called SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) which positions the car and the position of crucial landmarks (Cohen 2018, 2018), an AV can see and start to understand the world around it using machine learning and artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <p> AVs are thought to create a more efficient and safer world. For the most part, this thought can be argued as being true, but applicable in the scenario of AVs being well established in the world. The elderly and disabled population will not need to be reliant on carers for transport and will have their own modes of transport with AVs. The cost of commercial transport would become extremely cheap and accessible to all classes of society. It would on one hand, remove the need of taxi drivers and ride share drivers, but would create an endless stream of jobs to maintain, update and improve the systems of AVs. Our world will change dramatically where travel by AVs will become a norm. Everything from our public transport to personal cars, to trucks and more… that keep the population moving would potentially become driverless in the future. It is expected that eventually AVs will become fully electric as well, and thus cost of transport should be cut dramatically and the stress on carbon emissions from transportation should reduce (Marshall 2020).
    </p>

<p>The general population will experience fewer road deaths due to human error and living standards would be higher overall due to the removal of stress from driving. ‘The health implications of commuting are significant,’ says Dr. Nuttman from Deakin University’s Faculty of Health. ‘Regularly battling peak hour traffic and travelling long distances to work leads to poorer mental health, stress and an increase in road rage incidents.’ AVs will remove the need for drivers to drive, thus fostering an environment where calmness and relief replaces what would be anxiety and stress behind the wheel.</p>

<p>In my daily life, an AV will tremendously improve my mental wellbeing. I would have more time to sleep, as the car would allow me to rest while it drives me to destinations in the future, especially to work. This will allow me to be well rested, calmer, and less anxious when I would have to go about my life. It would reduce my exposure to stress during peak hour traffic, as opposed to nowadays since I must put all my focus on driving. I would be able to travel a lot more without the hassle of having to drive, and enjoy more of my leisure time exploring new places around home. My conscience would also hold less guilt as the world would be travelling on mostly electricity in the future, which places less strain on the climate compared to the amount of carbon emissions that transport contributes nowadays. </p>
<p> For my family, AVs will allow us to have less conflict in deciding who must go on errands with our parents. It will mean my parents will merely need to be passengers in the AV without any of my siblings or myself. We would not need to worry in the future about our parents’ mode of transport as AVs would be trustworthy in taking my parents from place to place. Cars would be used more if it were made available as an AV, as it would be easy to use and allow privacy unlike public transport, but of course at the possible expense of the environment. Overall, it would increase the living standards of our world as less time will be spent on commutes for every day drivers, and there would be less accidents on the roads due to human error. </p>

    <h3>APP NAME: STUDY CRUNCH 
</h3>
    <p>Overview .</p>
        <p>The project is to create an app, ‘Study Crunch,’ that will let users earn credit to use at restaurants or cafes when they complete study in timed sessions without getting distracted. The productivity cross food and drinks app takes inspiration from the pomodoro study technique which has helped many achieve greater productivity by breaking big projects into small tasks, and repetitively completing work in short blocks with relatively shorter breaks. The app aims to help mainly students who suffer from procrastination and distractions easily, ‘to work hard and play hard,’ by treating them to discounts to amazing meals and drinks. As 2020 was a tough year for our hospitality industry due to COVID-19, we were inspired to find a solution to help rebuild the hospitality sector in Melbourne by mainly aiming to work with small businesses to increase business exposure to the wider public and encourage spending with these businesses with these credits earned. 
</p>
    <p>Motivation </p>
    <p>In the city of Melbourne, based on the 2016 census conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 35% of the population were students. This is a vast percentage who, assumedly, would be required to study and complete work to progress in their respective studies. The ‘Study Crunch’ app targets this population to aid them in their studies by creating a unique and innovative incentive which is credit to use at amazing restaurants or cafes that exist in Melbourne. Interestingly, over 1 million Australians visit the app, ‘Zomato,’ monthly, which contains information of trending restaurants organised by cuisines and price point (Morgan 2016). This is a strong indicator of the ‘foodie (“a person who loves food” according to the Cambridge dictionary)’ culture in Melbourne, which can be linked to the potential success of an app like ours which will provide our users with the opportunity to enjoy great food at a discount, in exchange for their productivity. The study technique that inspires our app is known as the ‘Pomodoro style,’ which is a repetitive cycle of a short burst of productiveness (typically 20 minutes) followed by a short break (typically 5 minutes) until the user decides they are done for a session. From Dr. Gassaley who is a neuroscientist, and Dr. Rosen who is a psychologist, they mention that there is even research that confirms how dividing work sessions with breaks, which are rewards, increases the likelihood of completing work to gain the reward (Memon 2019). So with the added incentive of earning credit to pay for food, the productivity among students is expected to increase overall.
</p>
    <p>Description</p>
    <p>With ‘Study Crunch,’ every hour of completed, uninterrupted study, earns 10 cents credit that can be used towards a users’ choice of restaurant or café, who would have to be sponsors of the app. There will be different limits to the amount of credit that can be used depending on the type of business. For example, there will be around a max of $1.50 credit for cafes on their drinks’, and max $5 credit for restaurants on their meals. It is expected that most businesses would need profitable motivation to partner with this app, so if the discount that can be earned is too high, thus resulting in a loss for the business rather than a gain, they would not accept the sponsorship, which explains why these limits must exist in our app. At a rate of 10 cents for every hour of productivity, it would take 50 hours for one user to earn $5. Another measure to maintain realistic input of information by users, would be putting a cap of 7-8 hours of study a day (with breaks). This maximum amount of study time at 7-8 hours for one day, means it would take a week for users to earn at least $5 credit through the app.
</p>
    <img src="project idea pic 1.jpg" width="" height="">
    <p style="padding: 22em 0 0 0">
    How the app would run is that It is purely an honesty system. We put trust in the people who use it, that they are entering accurate information when using the app to earn credits for their productivity. ‘Study crunch,’ will be designed to be strict in how users earn the credit. There will be clear rules set such as leaving the app (with exceptions to be mentioned later), will render the set period as invalid, meaning the time spent ‘studying’ will not be included in the accumulation of every hour that will earn 10 cents. The user must finish the initial set period, so they cannot alter the set time, for it to be counted as part of one hour which can earn 10 cents. For example, one user sets the productive period to 40 minutes, completes it with the break and so this session counts towards an hour which is worth 10 cents. Another user sets the period for 40 minutes but leaves the app mid-way through their session. The 20 minutes is not counted towards the hour to earn 10 cents credit, and the timer will reset for breaking the flow. As the Pomodoro style is meant to be short focus sessions broken up with shorter breaks, there will be a minimum of 20 minutes that can be set for the study slot and a maximum of 1 hour and for breaks a minimum of 5 minutes and maximum of 25 minutes.
 
</p>
    <p>The app will be easy to use and set up, with android and iOS users only in mind for the present. It will have a minimal and simple design. There will be a navigation panel at the bottom for easiest access, that separates the timer, virtual wallet, calendar, and account details. The timer screen will allow users to set an allocated period for study and a period for breaks. The app will put the phone into an auto do not disturb mode, blocking notifications except for incoming calls which will not affect the focus period’s ability to earn credit if the call is taken. The virtual wallet would create coupons, in the form of a barcode to scan, for users to use in participating restaurants and cafes. It will also show a user’s credit balance here and their transaction history with the app. In the same section, included in fine print, the limits for items in each menu under certain stores and the information about the stores. The calendar will display the number of days that a user has completed concentration blocks, where they can change views from month, week, and day for extra detail. The account details will be where users find how to log in and out, the terms and conditions, their personal details and help and support information.
</p>
    <p>Tools + Tech </p>
    <p>
The process for planning and designing of the app will be done through softwares such as Figma to create the wireframes and Android studio and Xcode for the designing of the app. A platform that should be considered in the coding process is github, where multiple contributors can access, back-up and collaborate easily. As our app will require users to log in with an account for the precise tracking of their study habits and credit balance with us, we need to have a server which will store all this data safely for our users. The app uses a credit system which will generate a barcode to enable users to receive discounts at restaurants and cafes. This will require a linked software such as, ‘codeREADr,’ which can be input with the app that we create, where we would work as a third party with codeREADr. This particular company can validate each barcode that is generated uniquely for users, and is easily integrated (any device with a camera can view and verify the barcode) with stores that would partner or sponsor with the app.
</p>
    <p>Skills</p>
    <p>The code would be expected to be completed in java for android users and in swift or objective c for apple users. It will take time to learn these languages, and at the moment would not be feasible for beginner coders like us first years, to be able to complete an app like ‘Study Crunch,’ within a month. However, it is definitely possible to find programmers and app designers who are familiar with the programming languages as mentioned, but also who can use android studio and xcode to ensure the design of the app is minimal and simple. Structured Query Language (SQL) is another skill that would be needed for the database management of users’ private information, and the progress of their credit balance and past transactions. Considering the burning glass data, SQL is definitely a top skill that many IT professionals should have since it is highly seeked for, thus it should be feasible to find people with this skill. The app’s success is mainly reliant on being able to provide the opportunity to earn credit to use at restaurants and cafes, so lastly we would require a team that can source sponsors and can create legal contracts with these businesses to work alongside ‘Study Crunch.’</p>
    <p>Outcome</p>
    <p>If the project is successful, the outcomes are multifaceted. Firstly, the main aim of aiding increased productivity will be achieved, where the target of students will find it easier to study and get their work completed and an overall more productive society will come from it. This would hopefully become pivotal to encouraging more students to continue their studies and complete their programs, courses, and education. A more educated population can lead to a higher proportion of our society obtaining higher-education required jobs, further resulting in a more financially advantaged society, and perhaps happier one too with their newfound productive booster. Not only will it encourage more productiveness in our society, but also boosts expenditure in our businesses and economy overall. Behavioural scientist, Valk, says that, “according to the Pleasure Principle and the Regulatory Focus Theory, people seek pleasure and avoid pain [and] the anticipation of missing out on a discount is a pain people want to avoid.” Thus the potential credits that can be earned by users is ‘unmissable,’ meaning the user will most likely use these discounts to purchase food and drink items at more restaurants and cafés. </p>
